# S2Bot plugin for opentrack
This is a tracker providing 3D head tracking using the S2Bot helper application. 

S2Bot is originally a plugin that connect embedded devices with the [Scratch programming environment](https://scratch.mit.edu/). This plugin emulates the Scratch interface to get access to the sensor data from the various boards. It was developed and tested using the [micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk) board, but should work with any of the S2Bot supported sensor boards that have accelerometers and/or magnetometers. S2Bot is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
